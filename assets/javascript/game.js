// testing link between html and js

// letter strokes on keyboard can be tracked by onkey or eventlistener?

// incorrect and correctly guessed letters will de displayed on screen

// every incorrectly guessed word will deduct from the number of guesses remaining

// once word is guessed correctly, game will restart with a new word but keep track of the wins
