# Word-Guess-Game
This is hangman-style game minus the hangman.

In order to start the game, type any letter.

Every time you guess a letter incorrectly, the total number of guesses will decrease. Once this reaches zero, you lose the game and the number of losses will increase.

Every time you guess a letter correctly, the letter will be placed in its respective spot of the word you are trying to guess.

Once you guess the entire word, you will be congratulated with a message and the number of wins will increase.

You can continue for as long you'd like.

Try to beat my high score of 100 ;)
